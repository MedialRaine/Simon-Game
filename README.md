# Simon-Game

#### This project is a game in wich we put a lot of concepts to work, we made an array of colors, we initializate too two empty arrays for the game pattern, other for the user pattern, also we made two variable, one for knowing if the game is started, another for the level.
#### We use jQuery for knowing when a key has been pressed so we can initializate the game. Then once the pattern beggins then we can continue to unchain a function when the one of the four buttons are pressed, we push a new variable in wich we save the color chosen by the user into the pattern of the user, after that a sound and an animation will have unchained.
#### To all this we add another function for checking the if the pattern made by the user is the same as the pattern provided by the game, if its the case we call the function for starting a new sequence, if not we console wrong on a string, and we call a function for starting over. When you lose then also another style gets applied for showing that you loose.
